Two programs within this zip.server.cpp and client.cpptwo windows must be open in order to run them both.first, run server with 5 numbers after it (which creates the address)ex. “./server 12345”next, run client specifying that it’s a local host and the address that was previously createdex “./client localhost 12345”the server will ask the client for a password (password is “key”)after entering the password, the server will ask the client for a command and within the client you can enter a command such as “ls” or “who” and similar commands that you coul normally run within the shell.There is still a few things I have to clean up with the code and a few problems I have to program it to avoid like if the client exits before the server. but other than that it works. I will also add some more comments In the code
